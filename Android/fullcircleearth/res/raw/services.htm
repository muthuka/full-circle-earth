<h1 style="text-align: left;">FCE Community Enrichment Services</h1>
<p>As a social enterprise Full Circle Earth seeks to develop&nbsp;businesses, services and ventures to promote and demonstrate the economic viability of appropriate technologies. These ventures will provide services to the community via opportunities for residents, non profit, public and private institutions to gain the skills needed to build a sustainable economy.</p>
<h1>Core Services Development</h1>
<p>We plan to start with the following services described below:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong><a title="Organic Land Care" href="http://www.onevillagefoundation.org/FCE/?page_id=13">Quiet Cuts Organic Lawn/Land Care</a>&nbsp;(Healthy neighborhoods, Happy Hearts)</strong></li>
<li><strong><a title="Beverly Compost Initiative" href="http://www.onevillagefoundation.org/FCE/?page_id=16">Beverly Composting Initiative</a>&nbsp;(Reduce your Refuse)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Edible Growing</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We believe that the composting program will lead to synergy by allowing the use of worm casting/fertilizer producing from the composting of kitchen waste/scraps and other waste biomass.</p>
</div>
<h1 style="text-align: left;">Future Potential Sustainable Business Development Areas</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">We are looking at the following business development areas for future FCE income generating activities. Each area of development has a clear plan for addressing a problem or goal in that sector:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Organic Land Care</strong> – as part of a plan to reduce the use of pesticides and environmentally unhealthy land care practices</li>
<li><strong>Compost/Recycle</strong> – with the goal of making the North Shore region a leader in the compost initiatives that support national and state level initiatives to promote bio-waste recycling</li>
<li><strong>Growing</strong> – organic and healthy food in small gardens and greenhouses around Beverly and the North Shore that includes a goal to produce a certain percentage of foods eaten locally and grown organically. Focus will be in establishing biodynamic growing techniques and recirculating aquaponic systems.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Independence</strong> – support green energy companies like&nbsp;Viridian Energy to implement a Distributed Power Strategy for the region that include renewable energy as job and business creator for the North Shore region of Boston.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h1>FCE's Social Enterprise Focus</h1>
<p>FCE will operate as a social enterprise. Money generated from these services will help pay for the operation of FCE, the development of its <a title="Education &amp; Outreach" href="http://www.onevillagefoundation.org/FCE/?page_id=140"><strong>Education and Outreach Programs</strong></a>. This includes vocational training programs associated with these ventures. The longer range planning includes the development of a proposed headquarters and muli-purpose facility to be called the <strong><a title="Eco-Education Centers" href="http://www.onevillagefoundation.org/FCE/?page_id=18">Full Circle Earth Environmental Education Center</a>.</strong></p>
